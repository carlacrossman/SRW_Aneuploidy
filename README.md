## Detection of sex chromosomal aneuploidy (XXY) in a Southern Right Whale (Eubalaena australis) using read depth and coverage from whole genome sequence data

This repository contains data and scripts associated with *Detection of sex chromosomal aneuploidy (XXY) in a Southern Right Whale (Eubalaena australis) using read depth and coverage from whole genome sequence data*. It contains the following:

- **ZFX-ZFY_fasta** : This directory contains a fasta file of the ZFX-ZFY amplicons for each sample used in this study 
- **Aneuploidy_plots.Rmd** :  This R markdown notebook contains the code used to generate the figures.
- **merge_mark_coverage.sh** : This is the second script to run that merges bam files, marks duplicate reads and calculates coverage and depth across each chromosome.
- **prep_fastq_2_bam.sh** : This is the first script to run that trims and maps the fastq data to the reference genome

The raw data used in this study are archived in NCBIâ€™s Sequence Read Archive under BioProject PRJNA914998.
